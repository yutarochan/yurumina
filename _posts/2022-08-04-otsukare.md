こんにちは😄　

いつもは蝉の鳴き声がうるさくて2度寝できませんが今日はお天気も悪くセミたちも静かだったのでよく寝れました（笑）

なぜだかメンクリの次の日はとても疲れます。

なので今日は１日ゆっくり過ごしたいと思います。

皆さんも無理せずゆるゆるお過ごし下さい😊

Hello Everyone!

Usually the cicadas are pretty noisy so it prevents me from sleeping again for the second time.

However today, because the weather is bad, I was thankfully able to sleep well.

For some reason, I feel very tired the day after I visit my mental health clinic.

So today, I decided that I will take it easy.

I hope everyone has a relaxing day today.
