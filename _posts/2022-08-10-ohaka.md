こんにちは皆さん。

今日はお墓参りに行ってきましった。

母方のおじいちゃんの命日だったので行けてよかったです。

お昼はお刺身定食を食べました！

お刺身盛り合わせに大きな煮魚、ご飯とお味噌汁もあって満腹でした😧

外が暑すぎて溶けそうでしたがなんとか１日乗り切れました。

最近暑い日が続いてると思うので皆さんも体調等お気を付け下さい。


Hello everyone.

Today I went to visit the grave.

It was the anniversary of my maternal grandfather's death, so I'm glad I was able to go.

For lunch, I ate a sashimi lunch set.

It included sashimi, also a large boiled fish, rice, and miso soup and I was very full.

Outside was so hot, that I felt like I was about to melt. But I was able to survive the day.

These days, the heat wave is very intense, so please take care of your health.
