皆さんこんにちは😊

今日から日記もパソコンデビューです！！

可愛らしい顔文字が沢山あって楽しいです(*‘∀‘)

今日は朝から甥っ子がサツマイモ堀りをしていました！！

でも採ったサツマイモをほおり投げるという雑な甥っ子です（笑）

可愛かったのでよしとします‼😘

今日も皆さんにとって素敵な1日になりますように。


Hello everyone.

Today I will start to write my diary using my computer.

This computer has a lot of cute emojis and it’s so fun.

This morning my nephew was digging for sweet potatoes.

But my nephew was rough because he threw the sweet potatoes that he dug up.  

But he was cute so I forgave him.

I hope you have a wonderful day today.
