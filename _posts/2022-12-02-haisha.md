皆さんこんばんは🌙

今日は本当に歯医者の日でした。（笑）

昨日間違えていってしまいましたが、今回はちゃんと開いてました！！

今日はご褒美dayとしてコンビニでスイーツを沢山買って帰りました！！

明日も皆さんにとって素敵な1日になりますように。


Good evening everyone.

Today was actually the day I go to the dentist.

Yesterday I mistakenly went when it was closed, but this time it was open.

Today I decided to treat myself by buying a lot of sweets from the convenience store.

I hope you have a great day tomorrow.
