皆さんこんにちは🌞

今日は甥っ子達に少し早めのクリスマスプレゼントを渡しに行ってきました！

レゴを渡したんですが早速大喜びで遊んでくれました🤗

私自身もとてもうれしかったです😍

もうすぐ1か月の旅行が始まるので今からワクワクです！💕

今日も皆さんにとって素敵な1日になりますように。

Hello everyone.

Today I gifted my nephew an early christmas presents.

I gifted them legos and they were really happy and played with them.

I was also so happy.

I am so excited because I get to go on a month long trip.

I hope you have a pretty day today.
