皆さんこんばんは🌙
今日は念願の天野橋立に行ってきました！遠くて行く機会がなかったですが、長期で京都滞在しているので行けました🤗

股覗き台からみた景色はとっても綺麗でした！！

ロープウウェイに乗ったりモーターボートで島を渡ったりしてとても楽しかったです😍
ランチで食べた海鮮丼がとっても美味しかったです😋

明日も皆さんにとって素敵な１日になりますように。

Good evening everyone.
Today we finally went to Amanohashidate. It is usually very far so there isn’t really a chance to go but because we were staying in Kyoto for a long time we were able to go.

Seeing the view through the Matanozoki was great.

It was so exciting because we rode the ropeway and motor boat to cross the island.
For lunch we ate Kaisendon and it was so delicious. 

I wish you have a pretty day tomorrow.
