みなさんこんばんは🌙

今日はぴよりんモーニングからスタートしてゴッホ展に行ってきました🌻

モーニングでは可愛いぴよりんトーストにぴよりんも頂きました😙
可愛く美味しかったです🤗

ゴッホ展は本当に素敵でした✨
プロジェクションマッピングのコーナーでは、ヨギボーもありそこに座れたのでゆったり鑑賞することができました。😍
絵が何度も色々なものに変わるので見ていて飽きませんでした！
寝転がって見ていたので気づいたら爆睡していました😂笑

今日も皆さんにとって素敵な1日になりますように。

Good evening everyone.

We ate piyorin morning then after that went to a Van Gogh exhibit.

For breakfast we ate a cute piyorin toast and piyorin cake.
It was cute and delicious.

The Van Gogh exhibit was so beautiful.
At the projection mapping corner, there were yogibohs and we were able to sit there and relax while see some paintings.
The pictures were always changing so we were not bored.
We were lying down so I fell asleep.

I hope you have a good day today.
